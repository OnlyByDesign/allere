Allere SaaS Model | WordPress site for recruiting firm | HTML/CS | JS | jQuery | WordPress 

This website was a child theme using the Zerif parent theme
https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/

In this site, I was responsible for:
1. Complete design and development
2. Integrated and customized sliders
3. Customizing pieces of Zerif theme for client
4. Customizing widgets and plugins to meet client needs

They have since rebuilt there site, which is why it is not linked here.
